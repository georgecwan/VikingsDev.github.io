									At Vikings Dev, we run a number of project-based courses dealing with programming related subjects such as game design, web design, and Discord bots. Along with that, we host occasional lessons in various topics including blockchain, neural networks, machine learning, and object oriented programming. In our student-developed courses, we encourage coders to pursue club-directed independent projects related to the topics being taught. To learn more, click the link below.
